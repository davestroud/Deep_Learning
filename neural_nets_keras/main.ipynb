In other words, it can find out how each connection weight and each bias term should be tweaked in order to reduce the error. Once it has these gradients, it just performs a regular Gradient Descent step, and the whole process is repeated until the network converges to the solution."

    "\n",
    "> Each mini-batch is passed to the network’s input layer, which sends it to the first hidden layer. The algorithm then computes the output of all the neurons in this layer (for every instance in the mini-batch). The result is passed on to the next layer, its output is computed and passed to the next layer, and so on until we get the output of the last layer, the output layer. This is the forward pass: it is exactly like making predictions, except all intermediate results are preserved since they are needed for the backward pass.\n",

    "\n",
    "> The algorithm then measures how much of these error contributions came from each connection in the layer below, again using the chain rule, working backward until the algorithm reaches the input layer. As explained earlier, this reverse pass efficiently measures the error gradient across all the connection weights in the network by propagating the error gradient backward through the network (hence the name of the algorithm).\n",
